## Manually running the program

* Download and install [ActiveStateTcl](https://www.activestate.com/products/activetcl/downloads/).
* Dowload and install [Python 3.7.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/) or [later](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Run the code:

```
python3.7 tfg.py
```

In some systems (such as Ubuntu), the process to install `tkinter` may be different. For example, in Ubuntu is necessary to install the `python3-tk` package:

```
sudo apt install python3-tk
```
