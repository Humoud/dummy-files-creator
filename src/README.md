## Manually running the program

Dowload and install [Python 3.7.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/) or [later](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Run the code:

```
python3.7 tfg.py
```

By default, `tkinter` is already packaged in Python 3.7.0. However, you may need to manually install it in your device. The process to install `tkinter` may be different in some systems. For example, to manually install `tkinter` in ubuntu, you must install the `python3-tk` package:

```
sudo apt install python3-tk
```
